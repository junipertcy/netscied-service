# netscied-service

`netscied-service` hosts the source code behind the APIs for the Network Science Education Initiative in Taiwan [website](https://netscied.tw).

The goal of this project is to make network science accessible and _fun_ for all abilities,
through the collection of network datasets, tutorials and syllabuses, 
and open models of practical use cases.

Althrough we pushed the code to the public, the inner functions are still in a very raw state.
